### GumBox Enclosure
Gumbox is a funky little enclosure meant to hold your RaspberryPi. I purposefully built it to hold the pico board I run my picoprobe debuggers on.  For me, it converts the picoprobe into a compact package that can be easily moved between projects, and I no longer need to dedicate expensive breadboard real estate to debuggers. For you it could be anything that needs an isolated PICO.

I chose to call this ``Gumbox'' because it actually looks like one. This box snugly holds the pico with very little breathing space. There is an opening on the side for the micro-usb port, two tiny holes on top to expose the boot button and the status LED, and a slot on the side for the SWD and UART wires. To keep with the sleek profile, the cover for the case has no lids and must be glued in place (so apple of me).

The box is designed in FreeCad. The whole design is also parametric, so you can make any changes you want just by opening the spreadsheet (in FreeCad) and tweaking the values to your heart's content.
