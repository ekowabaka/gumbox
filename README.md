### GumBox Enclosure
Gumbox is a funky little enclosure meant to hold your RaspberryPi pico PicoProbe debugger. It converts your picoprobe into a compact package that can be easily moved between projects. You no longer need to dedicate your expensive breadboard real estate to debuggers, and even better do not have to waste precious CPU cycles spitting your programs internals over UART when debugging.
